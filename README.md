# 🗺️ Indoor Navigation System – Python Implementation

## 📌 Overview
The **Indoor Navigation System** is a **Python-based pathfinding application** for navigating within the college building.  
It uses **custom `(x, y)` coordinates** for each room and a **graph-based representation** of the building layout to compute the shortest path between two points.

## 🛠️ Key Python Features
- **Graph Representation** – Building rooms stored as nodes; connections stored as weighted edges.
- **Shortest Path Algorithm** – Implementation of **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** or **A\*** for optimal routing.
- **Image Overlay** – Navigation path rendered over floor plan images using **OpenCV** or **Pillow**.
- **Coordinate Mapping** – Each room assigned a unique `(x, y)` tuple for precise location tracking.
- **JSON Data Storage** – Room data stored in structured JSON for easy updates.
- **Modular Code Structure** – Separated into functions/classes for maintainability.
